# I learnt Docker just to deploy a django page...

page (https://djangoapp-spotes.b4a.run/)

my site has all the requieriments you need to upload this aplication on your own local host

the benefits of using django its that i dont need to enter the source to add something in the page, it almost works like a blog, because i can add new services or modify them from the admin site ðŸ˜„

i still  need to add the logo but that does't matter that much
